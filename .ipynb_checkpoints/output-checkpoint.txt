Abstract— Medical image processing has gained a lot of 
relevance of late and is turning out to be a boon in different 
clinical aspects. One such emerging field is brain tumor 
detection from magnetic resonance images (MRI) of brain . 
Engineers are actively developing tools to process medical 
images and aid doctors in with their diagnosis. MRI images are 
clinical images which are obtained on a computer when a 
patient goes through MRI scanning done by a respective 
machine. A brain tumor is a cluster of an abnormal mass of 
tissue where cell growth is out of control due to an abnormality 
in the mechanisms that control normal cells. In this work, our 
main aim is to measure the size of a brain tumor in terms of its 
diameter and area from a patient's MRI imagery using 
MATLAB. The proposed method incorporates different layers 
of noise removal techniques to clean up the images as well as 
image segmentation and morphological operations for 
detection and extraction of tumors and determining their size. 
By measuring the size of the tumor in a patient's brain at 
regular intervals doctors can diagnose the severity of the tumor 
in a patient's brain and can administer suitable treatment 
before it gets malignant. 
Keywords — Tumor, MRI, segmentation, MATLAB, 
extraction 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
 A brain tumor also known as neoplasm is an abnormal 
and excessive growth of cells that can have severe effects on 
the brain and its functionality. Brain tumors can be primary 
or metastatic, which are spread from other parts of the body 
to the brain [1 ]. It can be cancerous medically termed as 
malignant tumors or non-cancerous medically termed benign 
tumors [2]. Common symptoms of brain tumors are 
headache and nausea. Brain tumors are treatable and in non-
cancerous cases can be completely cured, without causing 
serious health issues, if diagnosed in the early stages. 
Imaging and early detection of the severity of the lesion thus 
becomes crucial for doctors to diagnose and treat brain 
tumors.  
The neoplasm in a suspected patient can be detected 
either by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or Computed 
Tomography (CT) [3]. In CT scan, the scanner captures 
several X-ray images taken from different angle and then 
combines them together to produce a cross-sectional image 
of the brain. In comparison MRI scanner produces high 
quality images using magnetic field and radio waves and is 
often preferred for anatomical analysis of brain development 
and its abnormality [4]. However, the MRI images of the 
brain depicts not only the tumor but also grey and white 
matter, cerebrospinal fluid , skull tissues present in the brain 
along with any noise associated during scanning [5].  In our current study, we thus use MRI images of the brain  
to extract and detect the size of lesion in a fast, effective, and  
accurate way by using different image processing techniques . 
In our proposed method we use the MATLAB image 
processing toolbox, to clean up the noisy image, use different 
segmentation method and perform different morphological 
operation to find out the diameter and area of the abnormal  
tissue growth which can serve as a crucial indicator of the 
severity of the neoplasm for the doctors. 
The rest of the paper is arranged as follows – section II 
lists down the various related works, whereas section III 
describes the various stages in our proposed method. Section 
IV elaborates on the proposed algorithm and presents the 
result of our work as well. The paper is finally concluded in  
section V along with some future directions.  
II.  RELATED WORKS 
 
Back in 2001, Sin et al [6], proposed an entropy based image 
segmentation technique for gray scale images by measuring 
the resemblance between an arbitrary template and the 
underlying true scene that gives rise to the actual image in 
terms of an index called the Gray – Scale Image Entropy 
(GIE). In recent times, researchers have proposed various 
such approaches in image segmentation for tumor extraction 
from MRI images of brain. In [7] the authors used differe nt 
feature extraction and image segmentation techniques such 
as Canny edge detection and adaptive threshold approach for 
identification of tumor from a brain MRI and then uses 
neural network technique for image classification into benign  
and malignant based on an image set of only 102 clinical 
images. In [8] the authors used modified histogram 
equalization followed by morphological operation to extract 
tumor from MRI images more efficiently. A simple machine 
learning classifier was also used for image classification. In 
[9] k – means and fuzzy – c means clustering techniques 
were used for color based image segmentation and tumor 
detection. In [ 10] Yogita et al, also used k – means clustering 
method and watershed segmentation techniques to find the 
radius and area of the tumor but their implementation did n ot 
involve any noise removal stage which will be a crucial 
feature in our proposed method. In [1] – [2] and [11 ] – [12] 
authors have used a similar image processing structure of 
noise removal from image, image segmentation followed by 
morphological operation to detect or extract the tumor from 
an MRI image, but the size has not been calculated in any of 
mentioned work which could be instrumental in determining 
the severity of the lesion. In more recent works [ 13] – [15] 
the focus has been in classification of brain tumor usin g 
brain MRI . As is evident in most of the methods tumor IEEE - 51525

extraction or classification has been the focus. In our 
proposed model we are not only proposing a tumor 
extraction technique but also means to determine it ’s size and 
area which to the best of our knowledge can prove to be 
instrumental in tracking the progress of the tumor or 
recuperation of a certain patient in case of early diagnosis. I n 
the following section each of the image processing stages 
required for tumor extraction followed by size determinatio n 
in our model are elaborated. 
 
III. METHODOLOGY 
 
The algorithm has three stages, the first being pre-processing 
of the MRI image followed by segmentation and performing 
morphological operations, finally finding the brain tumor’s 
size from the extracted images. The steps of the algorithm 
are as follows[2]:-  
1) MRI image of the brain given as input. 
2) Conversion of MRI image into a grayscale image.  
3) Application of high pass filter for noise removal 
followed by median filter for image enhancement.  
4) Application of threshold segmentation for conversion 
to binary image .  
5) Application of watershed segmentation to 
distuinguish between similar regions of interest. 
6) Application of morphological operation for tumor 
extraction .  
7) Analyse the size and area of the extracted tumor. 
 
 
 
Fig 1. The workflow of the proposed method 
A. Converting to grayscale image 
The imported MRI image is given as input to the 
algorithm. Then it is converted into a grayscale image. 
Normally when MRI images are looked at through a 
computer they appear like black and white images. The 
illusion of gray shad es in an image is created by presenting 
the image as a grid of black pixels in a sea of white ones or 
vice versa, where it is the size of the dots that determine the 
apparent intensity of gray in its neighbourhood. In general, 
the black dots are represented by R = G = B = 0 or 
00000000, whereas the white ones by R = G = B = 255 or 
11111111. As is known black signifies the darkest shade, 
occurring due to total absence of transmitted or reflected 
light while white results from the presence of transmitted or 
reflect ed light at all visible wavelengths and is considered as 
the lightest shade [2]. This is the justification for grayscale 
conversion. B. High pass filter and Median filter 
     The grayscale image is next passed through a high pass 
filter. The purpose of the high pass filter is to allow the high 
frequency information of an image to pass while 
suppressing the low frequency portion . In comparison to 
low pass filter a high pass filter sharpens the image and 
reduces the noise by using different convolution kernel. The 
noise reduction by the kernel of a high pass filter is done by 
improving the brightness of the central pixels in comparison 
to its surrounding ones. In the subsequent step the high pass 
filtered image is passed through a median filter which is a 
nonlinear digital filter that can provide further reduction in 
noise. The main concept of applying a median filter is to 
scan through the incoming signal sequentially , replacing 
each element of the input signal with the median of the 
surrounding elements . The combined effect of the two filters 
improves the quality of the MRI images. 
C. Threshold Segmentation 
      Then threshold segmentation is performed over the 
filtered image. This method is used to convert grayscale 
images to binary images. Segmentation is a method of 
dividing a digital image into multiple segments. Threshold 
segmentation mainly depends on the threshold value to 
segment an image. The key purpose of this segmentation is 
to modify an image representation into a simpler format 
such that it eases the analysis and further processing of the 
image. The major purpose of using image segmentation is to 
identify an objects or certain boundaries. The input to a 
thresholding operation is normally either a grayscale or a “A 
high speed parallel fuzzy c-mean algorithm for brain tumour 
segmentation” color image. In image segmentation pixels 
that are similar in color, intensity or texture are labeled as 
one for better visualization. In the simplest implementation, 
the output could be a binary image representing the 
segmentation. Black pixels correspond to the background 
while white pixels correspond to the foreground (or vice 
versa) [ 13] creating a segmented image. Conversion into 
black and white pixels results in isolation of the tumor. 
D. Watershed Segmentation  
      Thresholding has a high speed of operation and is easy 
to implement. However, its performance is relatively limited 
since image pixels having the same gray level value will 
indefinitely be segmented into the same set [6]. Hence, in 
addition to threshold segmentation, watershed segmentation 
is necessary. Watershed segmentation is a region-based 
technique which utilizes image morphology. It is used for 
separating the different segments in the image, when two 
regions of interest are close to each other i.e., if their edges 
touch. A simple watershed transformation causes over 
segmentation without preprocessing of the image i.e., image 
enhancement and noise removal [ 14]. As preprocessing has 
already been done in the earlier steps, over segmentation 
issue can be avoided. For gray scale images Meyer's 
flooding Watershed Algorithm is used. It requires selection 
of at least one marker interior to each object of the image, 
where the flooding shall start. The markers are chosen by an 
operator or, are provided by an automatic procedure that 
considers the application-specific knowledge of the object 
[15]. Now, the pixels neighboring the markers are placed in

a queue as per the priority of the gray levels of the pixel and 
are labeled accordingly. 
E. Morphological Operations 
      Morphological operation is performed to get the final 
tumor region. These are especially used to generate a new 
binary image from the existing one by incorporating non – 
zero value in a pixel either by testing whether the pixel fits 
in a given neighborhood or it intersects the same. As 
morphological operations solely depend on the relative 
sequencing of pixel values and not on their absolute 
numerical values it is better suited to the processing of 
binary images. A small matrix of pixels consisting of zeros 
and ones represent a structuring element within the image. 
The dimension of such a matrix represents the scale of the 
structuring element whereas the pattern of ones and zeros in 
the matrix provides the shape of the structuring element. 
The origin of the structuring element is normally one of the 
pixels in the matrix but is often times found outside the 
structuring element as well. At the end, the tumor is 
extracted from the MRI image. 
F. Size of extrcated tumor 
      Regionprops is used to measure properties of image 
regions in image processing. This function provides us with 
a tool ‘MajorAxisLength’ which can be used to measure the 
diameter of the tumor. To find the area, nnz matrix (number 
of non-zero matrix elements) is to be used which gives the 
area of the white region i.e., tumor region in terms of 
number of pixels. However, the size obtained would make 
more sense if it is expressed in terms of more traditional 
units such as millimeter. Finally, the size of the tu mor 
region is obtained as the result. The pixeled values can be 
converted into our required units i.e., millimeters using 
spatial calibration technique. This technique uses a spatial 
calibration factor which is original pixels of the image per 
millimeter (pixelpermm). The size of image we get in pixels 
is divided with calibration factor as shown in eq. (1) to get 
the results in millimeters.

where, 𝑙𝑚𝑚 is the length of the lesion in millimeter, 𝑙𝑝𝑖𝑥 is

IV. ALGORITHM AND RESULTS  
The dataset in [ 16] is used for the implementation of the 
current work. The algorithm of the proposed method can be 
described as follows 
 
        
 
Fig 3. Gray scale image 
 
Step I: MRI image as shown in fig. 2 is first imported into 
MATLAB. 
Step II: The selected MRI image is converted to grayscale 
using im2gray() function as shown in fig. 3. 
 
        
 
                   Fig 4. Image after passing through high pass filter 
 
Step III: The gradient magnitude method is used for 
detecting the sharp edges which is used later for 
segmentation of image.

Step IV: The pre – processed image is passed through a high 
pass filter to remove the noise. The image looks dull after 
passing through HPF as shown in fig. 4, so to improve the 
quality of the image a median filter is used. imshow() 
displays the binary image. For binary images, imshow () 
displays pixels with the value 0 (zero) as black and 1 as 
white.  
 
 
 
      Fig 6. Image after Watershed Segmentation        
          
Step V: Now a threshold value of 0.6 is used for threshold 
segmentation. We use the im2bw() function with the 
threshold value for threshold segmentation and output image 
is shown in fig. 5.  
 
 
 
Fig 7. Image after Morphological Operation 
 
Step VI: Next for segmenting the different parts of the 
image watershed segmentation is used. To do that, first

watershed ridge lines are needed and then the watershed 
transform is used for watershed segmentation. The label2rgb() function is further used to display a 
distinguished colored image as in fig. 6.  
Step VII: The morphological operations are further 
performed on the watershed segmented image to reconstruct 
the pixels creating a clear boundary of the final tumor region 
as shown in fig. 7.  
Step VIII: The size of the tumor is next measured in terms 
of pixels by using the different size analysis and 
measurement functions from the image processing toolbox 
as explained in section III.     
Step IX: The final step is determining the area and diameter 
of the tumor in standard units (mm2 and mm respectively) 
from the pixelated image of fig. 7 using the proper 
calibration factor in eq. (1) as shown in command window 
snapshot for a particular image in fig. 8 
 
 
Table 1. Comparison of MRIs with different sized tumors 
 
As a validation for our proposed method some MRI scans 
with visually distinct sized tumors has been considered. The 
diameter and area of the tumors in the different scans are 
tabulated in table 1 for comparison and are calculated using 
the algorithm elaborated in this section. It can be clearly 
seen that smaller sized lesion in the second scan has smaller 
diameter and area as is intuitively expected compared to 
other samples. 
 
V. CONCLUSION 
 
An MRI dataset was collected, and different operations were 
performed in MATLAB using the Image processing 
toolbox. Different techniques have been used to enhance the 
image quality so that extraction of the tumor region and the 
results for size measurement of tumor are more efficient and 
accurate. Observing the results of this project it has been 
evident that it will be quite helpful to the doctors to get 
accurate size of the tumor in terms of both diameter and area. 
Knowing the size in two different parameters assures doctors 
to carry forward with the required treatment as soon as 
possible. Since it is a computer-aided method the results can 
be considered quite accurate, reducing the chance of human 
error. Thus, this technique can be considered significant for 
brain tumor detection, extraction, and size analysis. Due to 
paucity of data the current work is limited to determination 
of tumor size and area only. However, in future 
deliberations this method can be further extended in 
classifying the tumor stage by analyzing the area of the 
tumor and comparing it with pre-existing data of a particular 
patient. Moreover, an analysis on change in tumor size over 
time can also be done by plotting a graph using tumor 
affected patients MRI images and determining the rate of

insights from the experts can prove to be a real boon in 
diagnosis and treatment of brain tu mor.
